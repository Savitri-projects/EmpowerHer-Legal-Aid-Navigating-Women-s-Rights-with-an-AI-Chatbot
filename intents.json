Physical abuse can also include the use of objects as weapons, such as a belt, a bat, a knife, or a gun.\n\n\n\nUnder the PWDVA, a woman who is subject to physical abuse can seek a protection order from the court, which will prohibit the abuser from committing domestic violence and also provide her with protection and residence. A woman can also seek an order allowing her to continue living in the shared household or to return to the shared household if she has left it. The act also provides for the appointment of protection officers who can be of assistance to the woman in such situation.\nAdditionally, the abuser may also be held liable to pay monetary relief to the woman for any losses suffered as a result of domestic violence.
